 *
 * The browser picks a file from the box's *width*, but a cover crop scales the
 * photo until it covers both sides. In a box taller than the photo's own
 * proportions the photo is painted much wider than the box, so the file the
 * browser picked gets stretched and goes soft. These helpers ask for the width
 * the photo is really painted at: `max(box width, box height x its ratio)`.
 *
 * The measurements below mirror the layout in `global.css`; `sizes` cannot read
 * custom properties, so they are rounded generously on purpose. Asking for a
 * slightly larger file costs bandwidth, asking for a smaller one costs sharpness.
